    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>I'm showing you my take on one of America's strangest hamburgers, and certainly the hamburger with the strangest name. But don't worry, this is 100% mollusk free. The name comes from the fact that these used to cost a nickel–and in the past, the slang term for nickel was "slug."     </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>7 slices potato bread</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>6 hamburger buns, split</li>
        <li>¼ cup prepared yellow mustard, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup dill pickle slices, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch chili powder, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees F (80 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cut the crusts off the bread slices. Place slices on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until dry and toasted, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer toasted bread to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until you reach coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Place ground chuck, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder into a bowl. Add bread crumbs. Combine with your fingers, breaking apart the meat.</li>
        <li>Dampen your fingers with water and form mixture into hamburger patties.</li>
        <li>Heat ¼ to ½ inch vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place a patty into the pan and turn heat down to medium. Cook until well browned and crusty, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining patties, adding more oil if needed.</li>
        <li>Remove from the pan and serve on hamburger buns with mustard and pickles; sprinkle tops of patties with chili powder and/or cayenne if you like prior to serving.</li>
    </ol>
